1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project analyzes a list of purchased items from a text file, calculating the frequency of each item. Users can interactively search for specific item frequencies, view all item counts, and visualize the data with a histogram. The frequency data is also saved to a backup file for persistence, aiding users in understanding purchasing trends quickly.

2. What did you do particularly well?
One of this project's strengths is its structured and modular design. The project improves both maintainability and readability by using separate functions for reading files, saving data, and displaying information. Additionally, I implemented input validation for user choices to prevent crashes caused by invalid inputs. The histogram representation is another helpful feature that enhances data visualization.

3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
File Handling: If the input file is missing or incorrectly formatted, the program prints an error and continues. A better approach would allow the user to enter a valid filename or use default data.
Performance Optimization: The program uses `map<string, int>` for item lookups, which is efficient, but switching to `unordered_map` could improve performance with average O(1) lookups.
Data Persistence: The backup file (`frequency.dat`) is created each run, but there's no option to load it back. Adding a restore feature would let the program pick up where it left off.

4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Handling file input and output was initially challenging, especially ensuring files were appropriately closed after use. I tackled this by reviewing `ifstream` and `of stream` documentation and experimenting with different methods.
I also needed to make user input more robust to handle invalid entries without crashing the program. I relied on online C++ documentation, forums like Stack Overflow, and debugging techniques to improve this functionality.

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?
File Handling in C++: Reading from and writing to files is a fundamental skill applicable in many types of software development.
Data Structures (Maps): Utilizing `map<string, int>` allows for efficient data storage and retrieval, which is beneficial in various problem-solving scenarios.
User Input Validation: It is crucial to ensure that the program gracefully handles user errors, which contributes to robust software development.
Modular Programming: Organizing code into functions enhances readability and maintainability, which will be helpful for future programming projects.

6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Modular Design: The program is organized into functions for each primary task, which makes it easy to update or extend.
Explicit Variable and Function Names: Meaningful names are used throughout the code, making it easy to understand.
Error Handling: The program includes input validation and provides error messages, enhancing robustness.
Scalability: New features, such as loading saved data or exporting results, can be added without restructuring the entire codebase.

Overall, this project adheres to best practices for readability, maintainability, and usability, providing a strong foundation for future development.
